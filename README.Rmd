fisdata makes it easy to download data from the 
[FIS webpage](https://www.fis-ski.com) into tibbles.


## Installation

You can install the development version of fisdata from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("stibu81/fisdata")
```

## Available Querying Functions

fisdata currently offers three functions to query different types of data:

* `query_athletes()`: query athletes by name and other attributes and obtain
  a table of matching athletes.
* `query_results()`: query all race results for a single athlete.
* `query_race()`: obtain the full results for a single race.


## Running a Query

Since athletes are identified by a Competitor-ID and races by a Race-ID
that are usually not known to the user, it is generally easiest to start a
query by finding an athlete. For example, the following call gets the
information for Didier Cuche:

```{r}
library(fisdata)
library(dplyr)

cuche <- query_athletes("cuche", "didier")
cuche %>% 
  select(active:nation, sector, brand, competitor_id)
```

The result includes the Competitor-ID, which is required as input in order
to query an athlete's results.

With the object returned by `query_athletes()`, it is now possible to query
all the race result of an athlete. Note that `query_results()` must be called
with a single athlete. The following query only obtains the results in
downhill races:

```{r}
cuche_res <- query_results(cuche, discipline = "DH")
cuche_res %>% 
  select(athlete:place, category:rank, race_id)
```

The result includes the Race-ID, which is required as input in order
to query the full results of a race.

By extracting one of the races from the table, one can now obtain the full
results for that race. The following code gets the full result for Didier
Cuche's last victory in Wengen:

```{r}
wengen_res <- cuche_res %>% 
  filter(place == "Wengen", rank == 1) %>% 
  head(n = 1) %>%
  query_race()
wengen_res
```

Note that the objects created by the querying functions always include the
URL that was downloaded. This URL can be obtained as follows:

```{r}
show_url(cuche_res)
```

You can copy this address into a browser in order to see the same data as
they are presented on the FIS web site. To make this as easy as possible,
`show_url()` automatically copies the URL into the clip board, when called
from an interactive R session.


## Known Limitations

Querying athletes and results is expected to work for all sectors and
disciplines. Querying races, however, is more difficult, since different types
of races have their results rendered in different form on the FIS web site.
fisdata is able to handle the results of many common types of races but it is
expected to fail for some types that are not yet covered. For example,
it usually cannot handle team races:

```{r error = TRUE}
query_athletes("von allmen", "franjo") %>% 
  query_results(category = "WSC") %>% 
  filter(discipline == "Team Combined") %>% 
  query_race()
```
