fisdata makes it easy to download data from the 
[FIS webpage](https://www.fis-ski.com) into tibbles. It provides a variety
of functions to query different types of data like athletes, events, or
race results.


## Installation

You can install the development version of fisdata from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("stibu81/fisdata")
```


## Available Querying Functions

fisdata offers the following functions to query different types of data:

* `query_athletes()`: query athletes by name and other attributes and obtain
  a table of matching athletes.
* `query_results()`: query all competition results for a single athlete.
* `query_race()`: get the full results for a single competition.
* `query_events()`: query events by date, place, and other attributes.
* `query_competitions()`: obtain all individual competitions that are
  associated with an event.
* `query_standings()`: get the cup standings with ranks and points per
  discipline.


## Example Queries

Use `query_athletes()` and `query_results()` to get Didier Cuche's full downhill
results:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(fisdata)
library(dplyr)

query_athletes("cuche", "didier") %>% 
  query_results(discipline = "DH") %>% 
  select(athlete:place, category:rank, cup_points)
```

Use `query_events()`, `query_competitions()` and `query_race()` to get
the full results of the Wengen Downhill in 2025:

```{r}
query_events(sector = "AL", place = "wengen", season = 2025) %>% 
  query_competitions() %>% 
  filter(competition == "Downhill") %>% 
  query_race() %>% 
  select(rank, bib, name:diff_time)
```

Use `query_standings()` to get the overall and downhill standings of the men's
alpine skiing world cup in the season 2022/23:

```{r}
query_standings(sector = "AL", season = 2023,
                category = "WC", gender = "M") %>% 
  select(athlete, nation, all_rank:dh_points)
```
