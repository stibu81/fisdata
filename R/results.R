#' Query Results for an Athlete
#'
#' Query results for an athlete using various filters. Omitting a filter means
#' that results with any value in that field will be returned.
#' Filtering is case-insensitive and for `place` string matches are partial.
#'
#' @param athlete a list or data frame with fields/columns `competitor_id` and
#'  `sector` that describe a *single* athlete. The easiest way to create
#'  such a data frame is through the functions [query_athletes()],
#'  [query_race()], or [query_standings()]. These functions
#'  can return multiple athletes, but `query_results()` only returns the
#'  results for one athlete. If multiple athletes are passed, only the first
#'  one will be used.
#' @param season year when the season ended, i.e., 2020 stands for the season
#'  2019/2020. It is not possible to filter for multiple seasons at once.
#' @param category abbreviation of the category of the race, e.g., "WC" for
#'  "World Cup". See the dataset [categories] for possible values.
#' @param place location of the race. The API does not
#'  support special characters, but many are handled automatically
#'  (see 'Details').
#' @param discipline abbreviation for the discipline, e.g., "DH" for
#'  "Downhill". See the dataset [disciplines] for possible values.
#' @param add_age should a column with the athletes age be added
#'  for each race? The age is given in decimal years. Note that for some
#'  athletes, only the birth year is known, in which case the age will be
#'  estimated.
#'
#' @details
#' All filter arguments are set to `""` by default. Setting an argument to
#' `""` means that no filtering takes place for this parameter. For those
#' arguments that have a call to [fd_def()] as their default value, the default
#' value can be globally set using [set_fisdata_defaults()].
#'
#' The API does not support special character in the field `place`.
#' The following special characters are handled
#' automatically: à, á, å, ä, æ, ç, ć, č, ð, é, è, ê, ë, ï, ñ, ø, ó, ő, ö,
#' œ, š, ß, ú, ü, and ž.
#' Other special characters must be replaced by the suitable
#' substitute by the user.
#'
#' The results are cached such that the same data are only downloaded once
#' per sessions.
#'
#' @returns
#' A tibble with the following columns: `athlete`, `date`, `place`, `nation`,
#' `sector`, `category`, `discipline`, `rank`, `fis_points`, `cup_points`,
#' and `race_id`. If `add_age` is `TRUE`, it also contains the column `age`
#' after `date`.
#'
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' # in order to query an athletes results, we first
#' # have to obtain the competitor id, which is
#' # required for the query. This can be conveniently
#' # done with query_athletes().
